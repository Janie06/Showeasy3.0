                        <p>International fairs are the best jumping board for sellers to sell their products into the world market and to enhance their brand. Because there are a great variety of industries with a wide assortment of products, comprehensive fairs, under the financial support of the Taiwan government, have emerged in the past few decades. Fair authorities would implement a series of marketing activities to attract potential buyers to the fair. Through such promotions, exhibitors are able to easily sell their products into international markets.</p>
                        <p>It is commonly known that mainland China has applied strict rules to control the import of electronic products. Eurotran's total logistics forwarding service not only provides a trouble-free, cross-border forwarding service for our clients, but also facilitates safe passing through China's customs. The process includes 1) Drafting the list of exhibits in Chinese; 2) Declaring the import and re-export of exhibits; and 3) Physical clearance of exhibits through Chinese customs inspection. Eurotran's branch office in Shanghai, G-Yi Int'l Logistic (Shanghai) Company Limited, ensures reliable on-the ground execution, which include transport of exhibits, personnel accommodations, surveillance of layouts, and display of exhibits.</p>

                        <p>For many years, Eurotran is also designated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of The Republic of China (ROC) (Taiwan), as the contractor of choice to execute all logistics and forwarding for comprehensive fairs in countries with Taiwanese diplomatic relations. Most of these countries are far away from Taiwan, which makes it difficult to control the estimated time of exhibit arrival. Eurotran is able to accurately control the delivery timing and is experienced in dealing with unforeseen changes. Some exhibits even become permanent exhibitions, which help reinforce formal ties between Taiwan and these countries.</p>

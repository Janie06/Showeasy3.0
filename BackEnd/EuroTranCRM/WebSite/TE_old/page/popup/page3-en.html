                        <h3>Engaged in various international performances and events.</h3>
                        <p>Eurotran expanded its business lines to the transportation of facilities and equipment for large-scale stage performances in 2009, and has worked with various international performance groups, such as Phantom of the Opera, Mamma Mia, Takarazuka Revue, Rent, etc.</p>
                        <h3>Adequate Communications and planning brings the best out of performances.</h3>
                        <p>In comparison to the transportation of exhibition goods, performance equipment handling has an even tighter time constraint. Taking into consideration the move-in and out schedule and unique geography of different performance venues, at the same time overseeing the customs clearance process so the equipment is delivered in time for move-in and its next touring stop is a challenge for detail planning. Eurotrans’ capability in planning and communication ensures precision in delivery of the facilities, and real time client support.</p>
